		At the <a class="underline" href="https://discord.gg/osu"
			>unofficial osu! game community discord server</a
		>, every once in a while we hold some events. This is an archive of the
		leaderboards and results for each of them.

			title="osu! Event #6 - Who let him cook?"
			date="2025-01-04"
			link="/event-6-who-let-him-cook"
		>
			In this event, players joined a lobby to play a selection of
			osu!mania maps. We have a list of Rice and Noodle maps that we will
			play through, switching between the two sets as we go on. The maps
			progressively get harder, until the very end, where there lies a
			tough challenge that our valiant players must face.

			title="osu! Event #5 - Riddle me this, riddle me that"
			date="2024-10-01 - 2024-10-31"
			link="/event-5-riddle-me-this"
		>
			You wake up in a cold, suffocating bunker deep underground, the air
			thick and heavy. Disoriented, you blink in the dim light, struggling
			to breathe as you ask yourself: How did I end up here? Where am I?
			Then it hits you â€” this isn't just a bunker. It's your prison.

		<TimelineItem
			title="osu! Event #4 - Can I haz beatmap?"
			date="2024-04-07 - 2024-08-19"
			link="/event-4-can-i-haz-beatmap"
		>
			Mappers were challenged to make a beatmap inspired by old styles.
			Choose an old map and try to take inspiration from it, while also
			applying modern mapping techniques to put a new spin on it.

			In this event we celebrated osu!lazer finally enabling PP. 20
			different maps were played as we revisited old, historic, iconic or
