            The Great Escape<br />
            <br />
            In a chamber of echoes where beats intertwine, <br />
            Three shadows linger, their purpose divine. <br />
            One whispers softly, with elegance concealed, <br />
            Sketching your fate on a canvas revealed. <br />
            <br />
            The second, a mosaic in a rhythmic trance, <br />
            A silent architect, shaping your chance. <br />
            With each touch, a symphony rises to share, <br />
            Crafted in different layouts where brilliance lays bare. <br />
            <br />
            The last glides like clouds, elusive and sly, <br />
            A phantom companion, as swift as a sigh. <br />
            With the help of photons, it guides every arc, <br />
            A dance in the dark, where precision ignites a spark. <br />
            <br />
            Solve this trio, break free from the trap, <br />
            What are these vessels that will spring the latch?<br />
